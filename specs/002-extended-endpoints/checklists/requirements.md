# Specification Quality Checklist: Extended API Endpoints

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec references Python method names in acceptance scenarios (e.g., `api.jobs.get_timeline()`) for clarity, but these are illustrative API surface descriptions, not implementation prescriptions.
- FR-013 explicitly requires a `research.md` design decisions artifact referencing ABConnectTools departures.
- Scope is bounded to HIGH-priority job workflow endpoints (~63). MEDIUM and LOW priority groups are explicitly deferred.
