# Specification Quality Checklist: Extended Operations Endpoints

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond established SDK patterns (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec references established SDK patterns (Route, `**kwargs`, RequestModel/ResponseModel, Pydantic conventions) from features 001 and 007. These are interface contracts carried forward as project constraints, not new implementation decisions introduced by this feature.
